## Synopsis

A simple, lightweight photogallery that I quickly created. Nothing too extravagant, just wanted to refactor an old code challenge!

## Code Example

To add your own photos, either add them to the 'public/images' directory or replace the default images in there. The last thing is to add the file name to the 'cartoons' array in the script.js file. No need to prepend it with the path!

## Motivation

This project was originally a code challenge that I did when I was still green, but now that I know a little more, I decided to refactor it!
